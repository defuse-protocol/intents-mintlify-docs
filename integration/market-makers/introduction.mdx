Market makers are active participants who deposit liquidity to fill quotes issued by users. To start market making on NEAR Intents, you need to handle two core functions: **bridging** (deposits/withdrawals) and **quoting**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A NEAR account for signing intents
- Liquidity to deposit (tokens on supported chains)
- Infrastructure to run a quoting service (WebSocket client)
- Familiarity with [the Verifier contract](/integration/verifier-contract/introduction) and [intent signing](/integration/verifier-contract/signing-intents)

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit liquidity">
    Use the [Passive Deposit/Withdrawal Service](/integration/market-makers/deposit-withdrawal-service) to move funds from supported blockchains into NEAR Intents.

    Alternatively, deposit via distribution channels like [near-intents.org](https://near-intents.org/).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to the Message Bus">
    Connect to the [Message Bus WebSocket](/integration/market-makers/message-bus/api) to receive quote requests from users in real-time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Respond to quotes">
    When you receive a quote request, evaluate the trade and respond with a signed intent if you want to fill it.

    See [Usage Examples](/integration/market-makers/message-bus/usage-examples) for implementation details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor settlements">
    Subscribe to quote status events to track when your quotes are matched and settled on-chain.
  </Step>

                                      │  Contract   │
                                      └─────────────┘
```

The Message Bus facilitates price discovery by:
1. Broadcasting quote requests from users to connected market makers
2. Collecting signed intent responses from market makers
3. Bundling matching intents and submitting them to the Verifier contract

<Info>
The NEAR Intents protocol can operate without the Message Bus. Frontends can use other quoting mechanisms, and market makers can index the NEAR blockchain directly to find intents to fill.
