The Message Bus is a system component that optimizes price discovery between users and market makers. It handles communication and submits settlement transactions to the Verifier contract.

![Message Bus Architecture](/images/diagrams/msg-bus.png)
## How it works

1. **User requests a quote** - A frontend sends a quote request to the Message Bus
2. **Market makers receive the request** - The Message Bus broadcasts the request to all connected solvers via WebSocket
3. **Market makers respond** - Solvers evaluate the trade and respond with signed intents
4. **User accepts a quote** - The frontend displays options to the user, who selects and signs their intent
5. **Settlement** - The Message Bus bundles the matching intents and submits them to the Verifier contract

## Optional component

<Info>
The NEAR Intents protocol can operate without the Message Bus:

- **Frontends** can use any quoting mechanism to compose and publish signed intents
- **Market makers** can index the NEAR blockchain directly to find intents to fill

## Endpoints

| Type | Endpoint |
|------|----------|
| JSON-RPC (Frontend) | `https://solver-relay-v2.chaindefuser.com/rpc` |
| WebSocket (Solvers) | `wss://solver-relay-v2.chaindefuser.com/ws` |
