![NEAR Intents Distribution Channels](/images/diagrams/distribution-channels-dark.svg)

Distribution Channels are the user-facing applications, wallets, and exchanges that make NEAR Intents accessible to end users. They handle intent creation, management, and asset delivery, while [Market Makers](/integration/market-makers/introduction) handle fulfillment and pricing.

## 1Click Swap API

The **1Click Swap API** is the easiest way to build a distribution channel. It's a REST API that handles intent creation, market maker coordination, and transaction execution—so you can focus on your user experience instead of protocol complexity.

## Direct Integration

For advanced use cases requiring non-custodial flows or custom settlement logic, you can integrate directly with the [Verifier Contract](/integration/verifier-contract/introduction). This gives you full control over intent creation and on-chain execution.
