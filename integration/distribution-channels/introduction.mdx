Token swaps on NEAR Intents are delivered through **distribution channels** — user-facing applications, wallets, and exchanges that integrate cross-chain swaps. Distribution channels handle intent creation, management, and asset delivery, while [Market Makers](/integration/market-makers/introduction) handle fulfillment and pricing.

## 1Click Swap API

The **1Click Swap API** is a REST API that handles intent creation, market maker coordination, and transaction execution. It is the recommended way to build a distribution channel.

## Explorer API

The **Explorer API** provides endpoints for querying transaction history and status. Use it to track swaps, build dashboards, or surface transaction receipts in your application.

## Direct Integration

For advanced use cases, you can build low level integrations directly with the [Verifier Contract](/integration/verifier-contract/introduction). This gives you full control over intent creation and on-chain execution.
