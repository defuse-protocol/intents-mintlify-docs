Token swaps on NEAR Intents are delivered through **distribution channels** — the user-facing applications, wallets, and exchanges that make cross-chain swaps accessible to end users. Distribution channels handle intent creation, management, and asset delivery, while [Market Makers](/integration/market-makers/introduction) handle fulfillment and pricing.

## 1Click Swap API

The **1Click Swap API** is the easiest way to build a distribution channel. It's a REST API that handles intent creation, market maker coordination, and transaction execution — so you can focus on your user experience instead of protocol complexity.

## Explorer API

The **Explorer API** lets you query transaction history and status for your integration. Use it to track swaps, build dashboards, or provide transaction receipts to your users.

## Direct Integration

For advanced use cases, you can build low level integrations directly with the [Verifier Contract](/integration/verifier-contract/introduction). This gives you full control over intent creation and on-chain execution.
