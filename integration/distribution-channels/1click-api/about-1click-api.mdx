1Click Swap simplifies NEAR Intents by temporarily transferring assets to a trusted swapping agent that coordinates with [Market Makers](/integration/market-makers/introduction) to execute your intent. This REST API abstracts the complexity of intent creation, solver coordination, and transaction execution.

<Warning>
By using the 1Click Swap API, you agree to the [1Click Terms of Service](/security-compliance/terms-of-service).
</Warning>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an API key">
    Register on the [Partner Dashboard](https://partners.near-intents.org/) to get your JWT token. Authenticated requests avoid the 0.2% platform fee.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request a quote">
    Call the [`/v0/quote`](/api-reference/oneclick/request-a-swap-quote) endpoint with the user's swap details. You'll receive pricing and a unique deposit address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="User deposits tokens">
    The user sends tokens to the deposit address. 1Click automatically begins the swap. Optionally use [`/v0/deposit/submit`](/api-reference/oneclick/submit-deposit-transaction-hash) with your transaction hash to speed up processing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor status">
    Poll [`/v0/status`](/api-reference/oneclick/check-swap-execution-status) to track progress and display updates to your user.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** The swap either succeeds with tokens delivered to your specified address, or fails with funds automatically refunded to your refund address.

<Info>
Centralized exchanges (CEXes) often use intermediate or per-user deposit addresses that may not credit deposits sent via NEAR Intents until they are recognized or whitelisted. Send a small test amount before attempting full-scale transfers.

## Swap Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PENDING_DEPOSIT` | Awaiting deposit to the deposit address |
| `KNOWN_DEPOSIT_TX` | Deposit transaction detected |
| `PROCESSING` | Swap being executed by Market Makers |
| `SUCCESS` | Funds delivered to the destination address |
| `INCOMPLETE_DEPOSIT` | Deposit received but below required amount |
| `REFUNDED` | Swap not completed, funds returned to refund address |
| `FAILED` | Swap failed due to an error |

## API Specification

**Base URL:** `https://1click.chaindefuser.com/`

Auto-generate clients using the [OpenAPI spec](https://1click.chaindefuser.com/docs/v0/openapi.yaml).

<Tip>
Use `dry: true` to preview quote pricing without generating a transaction. Set `dry: false` only at confirmation to reduce system load.
</Tip>

## Earning Fees

Distribution channels can earn fees on every swap. Configure fee collection when requesting quotes:

```json
{
  "appFees": {
    "recipient": "your-wallet.near",
    "fee_bps": 50
  }
}
```

This charges a 0.5% fee (50 basis points) from the input token, sent to your wallet.
