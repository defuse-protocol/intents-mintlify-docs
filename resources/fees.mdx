## 1Click Swap API Fees

| Authentication | Fee |
|----------------|-----|
| **With API key** | Only the 0.0001% protocol fee |
| **Without API key** | Additional **0.2%** fee |

<Tip>
[Apply for an API key](https://partners.near-intents.org/) to avoid the 0.2% unauthenticated fee.

### Distribution Channel Fees

Developers and distribution channels can add their own fees using the [`appFees`](/integration/distribution-channels/1click-api/fee-config) parameter when requesting quotes.

```json
{
  "appFees": [{
    "recipient": "your-wallet.near",
    "fee": 50
  }]
}
```

This example charges a 0.5% fee (50 basis points) from the input token.
