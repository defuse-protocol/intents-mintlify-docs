## What is NEAR Intents?

NEAR Intents is a multichain transaction protocol where users specify desired outcomes and market makers compete for best execution.

**An intent is what you want, not how to get it.** Instead of manually bridging, wrapping, swapping, and bridging again... Just say: _"I have 1 ETH on Ethereum, I want USDC on Arbitrum."_ 
Market makers compete to fulfill your intent, and smart contracts guarantee atomic execution.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="You create an intent">
  Specify your desired outcome: the tokens you have, the tokens you want, and where you want them delivered.
</Step>

<Step title="Market makers compete">
  Multiple market makers bid to fulfill your intent (quote request), competing on price, speed, and execution quality.
</Step>

<Step title="Smart contracts verify">
 Approved quotes are submitted to a smart contract ensuring atomic execution; your swap either completes fully or you're automatically refunded.
</Step>

<Step title="You receive your tokens">
  Your requested tokens arrive at your destination address, secured by on-chain verification.
</Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does NEAR Intents ensure security?">
  NEAR Intents uses atomic execution enforced by smart contracts on NEAR Protocol. Transactions either complete fully with all conditions met, or they're automatically reverted and your funds returned to your refund address. All transactions are verified on-chain before settlement.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What chains and tokens are supported?">
  NEAR Intents supports major blockchains including Ethereum, NEAR, and others. The list of supported chains and tokens is continuously expanding. Check our [Chain Support page](/resources/chain-support) for the current list.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the fees?">
  The 1Click API charges 0.1% (10 basis points) for unauthenticated requests. Authenticated users (with JWT tokens) pay no platform fees—only network gas costs and market maker spreads. [Learn more about fees](/resources/fees).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do market makers compete?">
  When you create an intent, it's broadcast to multiple market makers who bid to fulfill it. They compete on price, speed, and execution quality. The protocol automatically selects the best execution path while ensuring your terms are met.
