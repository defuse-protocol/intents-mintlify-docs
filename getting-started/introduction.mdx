## What is NEAR Intents?

NEAR Intents is a multichain transaction protocol that simplifies cross-chain interactions. Instead of navigating complex bridges, DEXs, and liquidity pools yourself, you simply declare your desired outcome and competitive market makers handle the rest.

**An intent is a declaration of what you want, not how to do it.** Rather than constructing specific transactions across multiple chains, you express your goal: "I have 1 ETH on Ethereum, I want USDC on Arbitrum." Market makers compete to fulfill your intent, and smart contracts guarantee atomic execution.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="You create an intent">
  Specify your desired outcome: the tokens you have, the tokens you want, and where you want them delivered.
</Step>

<Step title="Market makers compete">
  Multiple market makers bid to fulfill your intent, competing on price, speed, and execution quality.
</Step>

<Step title="Smart contracts verify">
  The NEAR Intents protocol ensures atomic execution—your swap either completes fully or you're automatically refunded.
</Step>

<Step title="You receive your tokens">
  Your requested tokens arrive at your destination address, secured by on-chain verification.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture overview

![NEAR Intents Architecture](/images/diagrams/architecture.svg)
NEAR Intents consists of three core components working together:

| Component | Role | Learn More |
|-----------|------|------------|
| **Distribution Channels** | Applications (wallets, exchanges, dApps) that enable users to create and broadcast intents | [Integration Guide](/integration/distribution-channels/introduction) |
| **Market Makers** | Agents that compete to fulfill intents, providing liquidity and execution | [Become a Market Maker](/integration/market-makers/introduction) |
| **Verifier Contract** | On-chain verification and settlement layer deployed on NEAR Protocol | [Technical Reference](/integration/verifier-contract/introduction) |

<Info>
**Recently renamed**: NEAR Intents was previously known as "Defuse". While documentation is being updated, you may see references to both names.

## Learn more

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does NEAR Intents ensure security?">
  NEAR Intents uses atomic execution enforced by smart contracts on NEAR Protocol. Transactions either complete fully with all conditions met, or they're automatically reverted and your funds returned to your refund address. All transactions are verified on-chain before settlement.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What chains and tokens are supported?">
  NEAR Intents supports major blockchains including Ethereum, NEAR, and others. The list of supported chains and tokens is continuously expanding. Check our [Chain Support page](/resources/chain-support) for the current list.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the fees?">
  The 1Click API charges 0.1% (10 basis points) for unauthenticated requests. Authenticated users (with JWT tokens) pay no platform fees—only network gas costs and market maker spreads. [Learn more about fees](/resources/fees).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do market makers compete?">
  When you create an intent, it's broadcast to multiple market makers who bid to fulfill it. They compete on price, speed, and execution quality. The protocol automatically selects the best execution path while ensuring your terms are met.
</Accordion>
