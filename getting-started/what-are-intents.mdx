An intent expresses **what you want** to achieve, **not how to get it**. Instead of writing code to bridge assets, find quotes, and execute swaps, you submit an intent such as _"I have 1 ETH on Ethereum, I want USDC on Arbitrum"_.

## How it works

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Steps>
    <Step title="You create an intent">
      Specify your desired outcome: the tokens you have, the tokens you want, and where you want them delivered.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Market makers compete">
      Multiple market makers bid to fulfill your intent (quote request), competing on price, speed, and execution quality.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Smart contracts verify">
    Approved quotes are submitted to a smart contract ensuring atomic execution; your swap either completes fully or you get automatically refunded.
    </Step>

    <Step title="You receive your tokens">
      Your requested tokens arrive at the destination address you choose, secured by on-chain verification.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
