Depositing funds into the Verifier smart contract is the first step for using it. The Verifier contract is [open-source](https://github.com/near/intents/) with transparent logic.

## Overview

Before you can trade or transfer tokens using intents, you need to deposit them into the Verifier contract. Once deposited, you retain full ownership and can withdraw at any time.
