The Verifier contract is a smart contract on the NEAR blockchain that serves as the atomic mediator for transferring assets among users in the NEAR Intents ecosystem.

<Info>
The former name of the smart contract is "Defuse". You may still see this name in some places in the codebase. It is planned to be updated in the future.

## Deployment

The Verifier smart contract is deployed at [`intents.near`](https://nearblocks.io/address/intents.near).

There is no testnet deployment.

## Source code

The contract is open source. You can find it on GitHub:

## Who is this documentation for?

This section is written for developers who want to:

- Interact with the Verifier smart contract directly
- Create payloads for the Message Bus (a matching system that brings together quotes from market makers with transaction requests)

## Prerequisites

Before working with the Verifier contract, you should have:

- A NEAR wallet (named account like `yourname.near` or implicit account)
- Tokens to deposit (fungible tokens like USDC, USDT, or wrapped NEAR)
- Basic understanding of [NEAR transactions](https://docs.near.org/concepts/protocol/transactions) and [cross-contract calls](https://docs.near.org/smart-contracts/anatomy/crosscontract)
- Familiarity with JSON and digital signatures

<Tip>
If you're new to NEAR, start with the [NEAR documentation](https://docs.near.org/) to understand accounts, transactions, and the basics of smart contract interaction.

## How the Verifier works

The workflow starts with the assumption that any participant in the Verifier smart contract has tokens [deposited](/integration/verifier-contract/deposits-and-withdrawals/deposits) into the contract.

In the NEAR Intents protocol, users express their "intent" to perform a transaction. Transactions can include:

- Transferring tokens within the smart contract
- Receiving other tokens in exchange
- Transferring to another user

Intents can be submitted directly to the smart contract, or bundled together by a third party (like the Message Bus) to be executed atomically.

## Example use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple transfer">
    Alice, the owner of `alice.near`, wants to transfer a fungible token to `bob.near`.

    1. Alice creates an Intent object of type `Transfer`, specifying `bob.near` as the destination
    2. Alice [signs the intent](/integration/verifier-contract/signing-intents)
    3. Alice calls `execute_intents` on the Verifier smart contract
    4. The contract transfers ownership of the tokens from `alice.near` to `bob.near`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token swap">
    Alice and Bob agree to swap 1000 USDT for 1000 USDC. Without a mediator, this requires trust—Alice could receive USDC and never send USDT.

    The Verifier solves this:

    1. **Deposit**: Alice and Bob deposit their USDT and USDC to the Verifier contract. They retain full ownership and can withdraw at any time.
    2. **Create intents**: Alice creates a `TokenDiff` intent expressing she'll give up 1000 USDT if she receives 1000 USDC. Bob creates the opposite intent.
    3. **Bundle and execute**: Both intents are bundled into a list. Either party calls `execute_intents`.
    4. **Atomic swap**: The Verifier fulfills both intents atomically—Alice now has 1000 USDC and Bob has 1000 USDT.
    5. **Withdraw**: Both can withdraw their tokens at any time.

    This is how peer-to-peer trading works on NEAR Intents. The Message Bus (or any third party) can act as the matchmaker that bundles `TokenDiff` intents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Withdrawal">
    From the previous example, if Alice wants to withdraw her USDC:

    1. Alice creates an Intent of type `FtWithdraw`, specifying the receiving address and amount
    2. Alice [signs the intent](/integration/verifier-contract/signing-intents)
    3. Alice calls `execute_intents`
    4. The Verifier verifies her ownership and sends the tokens to her specified address

    Withdrawals can also be done by directly calling the Verifier smart contract. See [Withdrawals](/integration/verifier-contract/deposits-and-withdrawals/withdrawals) for more details.
