1Click Swap simplifies NEAR Intents by temporarily transferring assets to a trusted swapping agent that coordinates with [Market Makers](/integration/market-makers) to execute your intent. This REST API abstracts the complexity of intent creation, solver coordination, and transaction execution.

**Key features:**

- Simple REST endpoints for intent creation and management
- Automatic solver discovery and competitive pricing
- Built-in transaction handling and status tracking
- Cross-chain swap support

## How It Works

1. **Request a quote** — Send the user's intent to the [`/v0/quote`](/api-reference/endpoint/quote) endpoint and receive the best available quote with a unique deposit address.

2. **Transfer tokens** — If the quote is satisfactory, deposit tokens to the provided address. 1Click automatically begins the swap upon receipt.

3. **Submit deposit transaction** (optional) — Use the [`/v0/deposit/submit`](/api-reference/endpoint/deposit-submit) endpoint with your transaction hash to speed up processing.

4. **Monitor progress** (optional) — Query the swap status at any time with the [`/v0/status`](/api-reference/endpoint/status) endpoint.

**Result:** The swap either succeeds with tokens delivered to your specified address, or fails with funds automatically refunded to your refund address.

<Info>
Centralized exchanges (CEXes) often use intermediate or per-user deposit addresses that may not credit deposits sent via NEAR Intents until they are recognized or whitelisted. Send a small test amount before attempting full-scale transfers.

## Quickstart

Get started with 1Click in the [quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart), or explore the [example repository](https://github.com/near-examples/near-intents-examples) for a step-by-step breakdown of cross-chain swaps using the TypeScript SDK.

## API Specification

**Base URL:** `https://1click.chaindefuser.com/`

Auto-generate clients using the [OpenAPI spec](https://1click.chaindefuser.com/docs/v0/openapi.yaml).

<Info>
Obtain a JWT token from the [Partner Dashboard](https://partners.near-intents.org/) to avoid the 0.1% (10 basis points) fee.

<Tip>
Use `dry: true` to preview quote pricing without generating a transaction. Set `dry: false` only at confirmation to reduce system load.
